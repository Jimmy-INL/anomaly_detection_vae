# Time Series Anomaly Dectection using a Variational Inference Approach
In this project we want to achieve anomaly detection in time series using a variational 
inference approach.

The project is divided in different files to achieve a more efficient modularization.\
The files used to define the models, the losses, the loading of the data, the training
and other useful functions are in this root folder and have the `ts_` (timeseries) prefix.\
Everything was put together in the notebook `main.ipynb`, that was used to train all the 
models with all the datasets and display the anomalies detected.

The figures and trained networks are available in the folder `runs`


Different notebooks are available in the forlder `notebooks`. They display the different 
architectures built, parameters used and results achieved in training (this means that some 
pieces of code look redudant because they have been placed there for reference).
