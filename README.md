# Time Series Anomaly Dectection using a Variational Inference Approach
In this project we want to achieve anomaly detection in time series using a variational inference approach.

The project is divided in different files to achieve a more efficient modularization.

Different notebooks have been setup to display the different architectures built, parameters used and results achieved in training (this means that some pieces of code look redudant because they have been placed there for reference).
